### Additional Settings

On the 'PDC instellingen' page there are 2 optional settings for extending the slug used in the 'view in portal' url.
The 'view in portal' button can be found in de wp-admin bar on the editor pages of the pdc-items or inside the 'quick edit' blocks on the overview page of pdc-items.
With these optional settings the theme and subtheme can be included into the 'view in portal' url.

Additionally, there is a possibility to use a fourth layer called 'pdc-groups'. The hierarchy, when the fourth layer setting is checked, is pdc-theme -> pdc-subtheme -> pdc-group -> pdc-item.

Finally, pdc-items can support multiple identifications for scheduling an appointment. Currently there are meta settings for DigiD, eHerkenning and eIDAS. You can set those values in the editor of a pdc-item.

## Connections

Some connections between posttypes are required for the portal to work properly. The required connections and in the correct order when filling the website:

1. pdc-theme -> none
2. pdc-subtheme -> pdc-theme
3. pdc-group -> pdc-item, pdc-theme and pdc-subtheme (pdc-groups usage is optional)
4. pdc-item -> pdc-theme, pdc-subtheme

## Translations

If you want to use your own set of labels/names/descriptions and so on you can do so.
All text output in this plugin is controlled via the gettext methods.

Please use your preferred way to make your own translations from the /wp-content/plugins/pdc-base/languages/pdc-base.pot file

Be careful not to put the translation files in a location which can be overwritten by a subsequent update of the plugin, theme or WordPress core.

We recommend using the 'Loco Translate' plugin.
https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/

This plugin provides an easy interface for custom translations and a way to store these files without them getting overwritten by updates.

For instructions how to use the 'Loco Translate' plugin, we advice you to read the Beginners's guide page on their website: https://localise.biz/wordpress/plugin/beginners
or start at the homepage: https://localise.biz/wordpress/plugin
